          <h6>Analyze Website</h6>
          <p>Use software that spiders and crawls your entire website and analyzes and gathers information about each
            individual page. It includes features that display issues with broken links, duplicate content, improvements
            to title and meta data, finds redirects, etc. Depending on how large your website is it can take from a few
            minutes to an hour to run but it is worth the wait. It will give you some of the best information on

          <h6>Disavow Tools</h6>
          <p>Disavow links are a method used to remove harmful links that are pointing towards your website which could
            damage your rankings with low-quality links. Search engines offer you a way to remove these backlinks coming
            to your website by using your account to identify links pointing toward your website so you can decide which
            links you would like to remove. When adding links to your disavow list, I recommend using SEMrush which has
            its own tool that locates links from around the web that point back to your website. It classifies links as
            either harmful or safe by a ranking scale which ultimately lets you decide which links you want to keep or
            remove. Once you compile a list of harmful links that you do not want pointing toward your website then you
            can manually upload a file or automate into disavow tools to request them not allow the links to be counted
            against you.</p>
          <p>You should note that search engines will sometimes show very different harmful links to disavow so you must
            manually create a list for each one if you want to catch every possible bad link pointing toward your
            website. If this seems like too much work you can just connect your accounts and it will do this for you
            automatically. Be careful using the disavow tools as removing bad links can improve your rankings but
            removing good links can harm your rankings.</p>
