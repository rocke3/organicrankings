            <h6>4 SEO Practices You Should Focus On</h6>
            <p>One of the most important factors in marketing your website is gaining organic rankings since it affects
              every aspect of your digital marketing, including <NuxtLink to="/user/seoimprove/paidads" class="">paid
                Google and Bing ads</NuxtLink>. While most people talk
              about Organic Marketing, they do not always take the time to fully understand how to rank your website
              properly.
              The first step is understanding four factors. The first and most important of these factors by far is
              Relevancy. The second one is coding your website properly for Speed, Performance, Accessibility, Best
              Practices, and SEO through Lighthouse to <NuxtLink to="/user/seoimprove/lighthouse" class="">measure the
                quality of the web pages</NuxtLink>. The third is on-page SEO and the fourth is off-page SEO.

                  Understanding Relevancy
                </h6>
                <p class=" text-justify">
                  Everything you add to your website needs to be relevant to the overall theme of your website. This
                  means that all of the information you include on your website, such as content, images, H-tags,
                  keywords, blog posts, links, reviews, etc. all need to be information that ties in with what your
                  website is really about. It also means that everything you put on your website must be information
                  that your users are looking for, find interesting, and want to engage with. Remember, search engines
                  are in the business of serving the best and most relevant content to their users so that they will
                  keep coming back to them. Give them what they’re looking for and you’ll be <NuxtLink
                    to="/user/seoimprove/">rewarded with higher rankings</NuxtLink>. Once your
                  website has been deemed relevant by the search engines, new content you put up
                  will enjoy a <NuxtLink to="/user/seoimprove/maintainingrankings">boost in the
                    SERPs</NuxtLink>
                  and improve your overall ROI (Return On Investment). In other words,
                  create a user experience that you yourself would want to have when searching the web and it’ll pay
                  off
                  every time with higher rankings and happier users.

                  Why Update Your Code
                </h6>
                <p class=" text-justify">
                  Updating your code with improvements for Lighthouse and <NuxtLink to="/user/seoimprove/codingerrors">
                    correcting errors in your HTML</NuxtLink> are a perfect
                  way to improve your user experience and prevent some users' inability to use your website. Updates can
                  include serving images in next-gen formats, avoiding chaining critical requests, <NuxtLink
                    to="/user/seoimprove/criticalcss">adding Critical CSS</NuxtLink>,
                  removing duplicate content, displaying elements of the page being hidden between devices through your
                  responsive website designs, etc. Correcting coding issues such as these and following Lighthouse
                  guidelines will dramatically improve your rankings in the SERPs (Search Engine Results Page).

                  On-page SEO or often called onpage optimization are the actions you take on your website to improve
                  your webpages for ranking in the search engines. For example, if you want to improve the individual
                  pages on your website, then creating unique and relevant content will give you a big boost. Another
                  option is improving your <NuxtLink to="/user/seoimprove/improvingcontent">image optimization
                  </NuxtLink> with modern formats such as next-gen formats such as AVIF
