            <h6>Testing What Your Users See</h6>
            <p>It is important for website owners to understand what their customers see when they come to their
              website. User Experience is one of <a href="https://www.organicrankings.com/seopractices.php">highest
                ranking factors</a>, especially RankBrain, so you should pay close
              attention to it. Below are some of the best programs I have used to measure User (UX) Experience. You will
              get an overview of what they see and discover issues you might be overlooking on your website so you can
              provide more relevant results from your web pages for search engine queries.</p>

          <h6>Testing Responsive Website</h6>
          <p>Test your responsive website to see how it looks on your desktop, iPad and even mobile devices.</p>

          <h6>Testing Website on Browsers</h6>
          <p>Test your website on all the browsers for current and past versions including testing on all mobile devices
            for Android and iPhone.</p>

          <h6>Visual Analytics</h6>
          <p>When you use visual analytics programs you are allowing a software to record the behaviors of your users on
            your website. It is an excellent tool for finding issues with desktop and mobile devices which will analyze
            the data so you know how to improve your customer UX experience.</p>
          <p>It is important to make sure that you are not violating any laws when using visual analytics tools such as
            with the <a href="https://www.organicrankings.com/websitelaws.php">GDPR and CCPA Compliance</a> which you
            can disclose in your privacy policy and Compliance and Consent software which you will learn about in a
            later chapter. When using the software you must also hide private customer information and credit cards if
            you are recording customers coming through your website and then note that you are using the software in
            your Privacy Policy, User Agreement and/or Cookie Disclaimers of your website. With Visual Analyitics you
            can improve your ROI with accurate visual analysis of what the user is experiencing on your website that
            might be otherwise very difficult to see with other programs.</p>

          <h6>XML Sitemaps</h6>
          <p>An xml sitemap is designed to list a website’s most important pages so that Google and Bing can crawl them
            all. It can also help the search engines understand your <a
              href="https://www.organicrankings.com/richresults.php">website structure</a>. If you did not properly link
            all of your pages when you built your website this will help get your pages crawled.</p>

          <h6>Compare Code</h6>
          <p>If you are needing to compare new code versus old code, this is a great program to help clean up any
            issues:</p>

          <h6>Website Authority Checker</h6>
          <p>If you want to view how your website’s strength is measured, you can test it and see how it compares to
            others.</p>
