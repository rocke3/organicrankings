            <h6>Speed Up Your Website</h6>
            <p>Speed is an important factor in ranking your website but also in retaining customers and improving your
              ROI. If you have made the changes explained in this book up to this point and have implemented items such
              as Critical CSS, optimized your website, fixed issues and errors in your code including with <NuxtLink
                to="/user/seoimprove/htmlvalidators">HTML Validator</NuxtLink>, corrected issues in
              <NuxtLink to="/user/seoimprove/lighthouse">Lighthouse</NuxtLink> and changed your
              <NuxtLink to="/user/seoimprove/codingHtaccess">.htaccess file</NuxtLink> to compress files
              and created a cache length on them then you should have already seen a dramatic improvement on your page
              speed by the time you get to this section.
            </p>
            <p>If you are seeing improvement in speed but having a hard time speeding up your website to your desired
              goals then there could be other issues to resolve. If you have a database driven website such as
              WordPress, Joomla and Magento then it will be naturally slow as it is rendering each page as it is
              loading. You can improve your website’s speed with plugins that can help with optimizing and improving
              your website’s speed. I personally prefer to run a static website (using no CMS system) and then use
              elements from a database as needed. I also move all of the javascripts that are not needed to make the
              page function to the bottom of the code. This can help speed up your website so it is not loading a large
              javascript file from the header and slowing down the page. Another way you can improve your speed is by
              adding async to the inline of the script. This will delay the load of the script and can improve the speed
              of your site:</p>
            <p><span class="htmlCode">script src="https://www.Your-Website.com/your-file.js" async</span><span
                class="htmlCode">/script</span></p>
            <p>Another reason your website might be slow could be due to your server or hosting provider you are using.
              If you are using a shared server with hundreds of other websites, then it takes only one website to slow
              everyone else down. Consider using a non-shared server such as a dedicated server or having your own IP
              address can help improve the speed of your server.</p>
