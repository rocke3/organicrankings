            <h6>Compliance and Consent</h6>
            <p>As businesses continue to gather private information from their customers, so do the regulations that now
              go along with it. There are a few things website owners should know about before they do business,
              especially in certain countries. Below are some of the most important compliance and consent regulations
              you need to know.</p>

        <div class="mt-3 px-xl-5">
          <h6>Consent Management System</h6>
          <p>Businesses must now comply with the GDPR and CCPA guidelines regarding a customer’s private information
            while using your website. Currently these laws apply to a few places such as all of Europe, California,
            Brazil, etc but will most likely become global over time so it is important that you keep up with who is
            requiring compliance and consent. You can require every user to comply and then you don’t have to worry
            about updating the list as new countries adopt these laws. You will need to have a script that protects the
            privacy of your website visitors and how you use their information. You can test your scripts with any VPN
            service as long as you change your location to any of the countries requiring it. If you connected your VPN
            to test an area be sure to clear your cookies as it will most likely not update to the new location until
            you do so. Here are some software companies offering this service:</p>

              src="https://www.organicrankings.com/assets/cookiecompliance.jpg" alt="Cookie Compliance" />
          </div>

          <h6>ADA Compliance</h6>
          <p>If you own a website you will want to make your website ADA compliant. While many website owners are
            unaware of these laws for websites there are lawyers filing suit against larger companies for not complying.
            The Americans with Disabilities Act Standards for Accessible Design (ADA) has standards they want
            implemented on websites to improve the experience for those with disabilities. Here are some software
            companies offering this service:</p>

          <h6>Color Blindness Accessibility</h6>
          <p>When people talk about color blindness accessibility it simply refers to that you design website elements
            in a way so that users that are unable to view the full color spectrum can adjust the page to view it as
            intended. There are many elements of Color Accessibility that you will want to adjust for such as the color
            of the text, color of the background and saturation. You can further improve the user experience by
            accommodating the various patterns, text sizes including the ratio of size the user wants to contrast.</p>

            <img class=" img-fluid border rounded shadow" src="https://www.organicrankings.com/assets/colorcontrast.jpg"
              alt="Color Blindness Accessibility" />
          </div>

          <h6>Accessible Font Sizes</h6>
          <p>While there is no enforced compliance from the ADA for a minimum size font for your web pages for website
            use you should strive for at least 16px. One way to comply with those with disabilities is to add an
            Accessible Font Sizes. This is where your users can adjust the size of the fonts on a page to be larger or
            smaller to fit their needs.</p>
          <div class=" text-center mb-4">
            <img class=" img-fluid border rounded shadow" src="https://www.organicrankings.com/assets/fontsizes.jpg"
              alt="Accessible Font Sizes" />
          </div>

          <h6>Skip Navigation Links</h6>
          <p>Why should you use "skip navigation"? There are two purposes for using it. First you show the SERPs where
            your main content of your web pages are by enclosing them within your <span class="htmlCode">main</span>
            tags. Second, using it helps those with certain disabilities. By adding a named anchor on the page you can
            determine where the main content of a website begins and ends. Some will say it is a deceptive way to hide
            texts and links but they clearly state that not all hidden text and links are viewed as a negative or that
            you will be penalized for adding hidden links to your web pages.</p>

          <p>This is what Google says about it:<br />
            "Hiding text or links in your content to manipulate Google’s search rankings can be seen as deceptive and is
            a violation of Google’s Webmaster Guidelines. Text (such as excessive keywords) can be hidden in several
            ways"</p>
          <p>In addition it also states:<br />
            "However, not all hidden text is considered deceptive."</p>
          <p>So if your intention is to manipulate your rankings in the SERPs or attempting to deceive your users then
            you could find yourself penalized by search egnines. I have used "skip navigation" for years and see it as a
            plus for not only rankings but also those with disabilities. Here is an example below of how it looks when a
            user hits the tab button on their keyboard. You can try this on this current page to see what it looks like
            live:</p>

              alt="Skip to Content Links" />
          </div>

            style="max-width: 700px;margin: auto;">
            <h6 class="text-bold">
